		<h1>Types, Values, and Variables</h1>
        <br>
        <p>
            Computer programs work by manipulating values, such as the number 3.14 or the
            text “Hello World.” The kinds of values that can be represented and manipulated in a
            programming language are known as types, and one of the most fundamental characteristics 
            of a programming language is the set of types it supports. When a program
            needs to retain a value for future use, it assigns the value to (or “stores” the value in) a
            variable. Variables have names, and they allow use of those names in our programs to
            refer to values. The way that variables work is another fundamental characteristic of
            any programming language. This chapter explains types, values, and variables in Java‐
            Script. It begins with an overview and some definitions.
