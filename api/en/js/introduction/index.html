		<h1>Introduction to JavaScript</h1>
        <br>
        <p>
            JavaScript is the programming language of the web. The overwhelming majority of
            websites use JavaScript, and all modern web browsers—on desktops, tablets, and
            phones—include JavaScript interpreters, making JavaScript the most-deployed pro‐
            gramming language in history. Over the last decade, Node.js has enabled JavaScript
            programming outside of web browsers, and the dramatic success of Node means that
            JavaScript is now also the most-used programming language among software devel‐
            opers. Whether you’re starting from scratch or are already using JavaScript professio‐
            nally, this book will help you master the language.
        </p>
        <p>
            If you are already familiar with other programming languages, it may help you to
            know that JavaScript is a high-level, dynamic, interpreted programming language that
            is well-suited to object-oriented and functional programming styles. JavaScript’s vari‐
            ables are untyped. Its syntax is loosely based on Java, but the languages are otherwise
            unrelated. JavaScript derives its first-class functions from Scheme and its prototype 
            based inheritance from the little-known language Self. But you do not need to know
            any of those languages, or be familiar with those terms, to use this book and learn
            JavaScript.
        </p>
        <p>
            The name “JavaScript” is quite misleading. Except for a superficial syntactic resemblance, 
            JavaScript is completely different from the Java programming language. And
            JavaScript has long since outgrown its scripting-language roots to become a robust
            and efficient general-purpose language suitable for serious software engineering and
            projects with huge codebases.
        </p>
        <p>
            To be useful, every language must have a platform, or standard library, for performing 
            things like basic input and output. The core JavaScript language defines a minimal API 
            for working with numbers, text, arrays, sets, maps, and so on, but does not
            include any input or output functionality. Input and output (as well as more sophisticated 
            features, such as networking, storage, and graphics) are the responsibility of the
            “host environment” within which JavaScript is embedded.
        </p>
        <p>
            The original host environment for JavaScript was a web browser, and this is still the
            most common execution environment for JavaScript code. The web browser environment allows 
            JavaScript code to obtain input from the user’s mouse and keyboard and by making HTTP requests. 
            And it allows JavaScript code to display output to the user with HTML and CSS.
        </p>
        <p>
            Since 2010, another host environment has been available for JavaScript code. Instead
            of constraining JavaScript to work with the APIs provided by a web browser, Node
            gives JavaScript access to the entire operating system, allowing JavaScript programs to
            read and write files, send and receive data over the network, and make and serve
            HTTP requests. Node is a popular choice for implementing web servers and also a
            convenient tool for writing simple utility scripts as an alternative to shell scripts.
        </p>
        <p>
            Most of this book is focused on the JavaScript language itself. Chapter 11 documents
            the JavaScript standard library, Chapter 15 introduces the web browser host environment, 
            and Chapter 16 introduces the Node host environment.
        </p>
        <p>
            This book covers low-level fundamentals first, and then builds on those to more
            advanced and higher-level abstractions. The chapters are intended to be read more or
            less in order. But learning a new programming language is never a linear process, and
            describing a language is not linear either: each language feature is related to other features, 
            and this book is full of cross-references—sometimes backward and sometimes
            forward—to related material. This introductory chapter makes a quick first pass
            through the language, introducing key features that will make it easier to understand
            the in-depth treatment in the chapters that follow. If you are already a practicing JavaScript 
            programmer, you can probably skip this chapter. (Although you might enjoy
            reading Example 1-1 at the end of the chapter before you move on.)
