		<h1>Exploring JavaScript</h1>
        <br>
        <p>
            When learning a new programming language, itâ€™s important to try the examples in
            the book, then modify them and try them again to test your understanding of the language. 
            To do that, you need a JavaScript interpreter.
        </p>
        <p>
            The easiest way to try out a few lines of JavaScript is to open up the web developer
            tools in your web browser (with F12, Ctrl-Shift-I, or Command-Option-I) and select
            the Console tab. You can then type code at the prompt and see the results as you type.
            Browser developer tools often appear as panes at the bottom or right of the browser
            window, but you can usually detach them as separate windows (as pictured in
            Figure 1-1), which is often quite convenient.
        </p>
        <p>
            Another way to try out JavaScript code is to download and install Node from https://
            nodejs.org. Once Node is installed on your system, you can simply open a Terminal
            window and type node to begin an interactive JavaScript session like this one:
        </p>

        <code>
            $ node
            Welcome to Node.js v12.13.0.
            Type ".help" for more information.
            > .help
            .break Sometimes you get stuck, this gets you out
            .clear Alias for .break
            .editor Enter editor mode
            .exit Exit the repl
            .help Print this help message
            .load Load JS from a file into the REPL session
            .save Save all evaluated commands in this REPL session to a file
            Press ^C to abort current expression, ^D to exit the repl
            > let x = 2, y = 3;
            undefined
            > x + y
            5
            > (x === 2) && (y === 3)
            true
            > (x > 3) || (y < 3)
            false
        </code>
