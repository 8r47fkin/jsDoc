		<h1>Hello World</h1>
        <br>
        <p>
            When you are ready to start experimenting with longer chunks of code, these line-by line 
            interactive environments may no longer be suitable, and you will probably prefer
            to write your code in a text editor. From there, you can copy and paste to the JavaScript 
            console or into a Node session. Or you can save your code to a file (the traditional filename 
            extension for JavaScript code is .js) and then run that file of JavaScript
            code with Node:
        </p>
        <code>
            $ node snippet.js
        </code>
        <p>
            If you use Node in a noninteractive manner like this, it won’t automatically print out
            the value of all the code you run, so you’ll have to do that yourself. You can use the
            function console.log() to display text and other JavaScript values in your terminal
            window or in a browser’s developer tools console. So, for example, if you create a
            hello.js file containing this line of code:
        <code>
            console.log("Hello World!");
        </code>
        and execute the file with node hello.js, you’ll see the message “Hello World!”
        printed out.
        </p>
        <p>
            If you want to see that same message printed out in the JavaScript console of a web
            browser, create a new file named hello.html, and put this text in it:
            <code>
               <xmp>script src="hello.js"> /script</xmp> 
            </code>
            Then load hello.html into your web browser using a file:// URL like this one:
            <code>
                file:///Users/username/javascript/hello.html
            </code>
            Open the developer tools window to see the greeting in the console.
        </p>
