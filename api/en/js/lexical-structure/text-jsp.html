		<h1>The Text of a JavaScript Program</h1>
        <br>
        <p>
            JavaScript is a case-sensitive language. This means that language keywords, variables,
            function names, and other identifiers must always be typed with a consistent capitalization 
            of letters. The while keyword, for example, must be typed “while,” not “While”
            or “WHILE.” Similarly, online, Online, OnLine, and ONLINE are four distinct variable
            names.

            JavaScript ignores spaces that appear between tokens in programs. For the most part,
            JavaScript also ignores line breaks (but see §2.6 for an exception). Because you can
            use spaces and newlines freely in your programs, you can format and indent your
            programs in a neat and consistent way that makes the code easy to read and
            understand.
        </p>
        <p>
            In addition to the regular space character (\u0020), JavaScript also recognizes tabs,
            assorted ASCII control characters, and various Unicode space characters as white‐
            space. JavaScript recognizes newlines, carriage returns, and a carriage return/line feed
            sequence as line terminators.
