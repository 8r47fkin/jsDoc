		<h1>Identifers and Reserved Words</h1>
        <br>
        <p>
            An identifier is simply a name. In JavaScript, identifiers are used to name constants,
            variables, properties, functions, and classes and to provide labels for certain loops in
            JavaScript code. A JavaScript identifier must begin with a letter, an underscore (_), or
            a dollar sign ($). Subsequent characters can be letters, digits, underscores, or dollar
            signs. (Digits are not allowed as the first character so that JavaScript can easily 
            distinguish identifiers from numbers.) These are all legal identifiers:
            <code>
                i
                my_variable_name
                v13
                _dummy
                $str
            </code>
            Like any language, JavaScript reserves certain identifiers for use by the language itself.
            These “reserved words” cannot be used as regular identifiers. They are listed in the
            next section.
		<p>
        <h1>
            Reserved Words
        </h1>
        <p>
            The following words are part of the JavaScript language. Many of these (such as if,
            while, and for) are reserved keywords that must not be used as the names of constants, 
            variables, functions, or classes (though they can all be used as the names of
            properties within an object). Others (such as from, of, get, and set) are used in limited 
            contexts with no syntactic ambiguity and are perfectly legal as identifiers. Still
            other keywords (such as let) can’t be fully reserved in order to retain backward compatibility 
            with older programs, and so there are complex rules that govern when they
            can be used as identifiers and when they cannot. (let can be used as a variable name
            if declared with var outside of a class, for example, but not if declared inside a class or
            with const.) The simplest course is to avoid using any of these words as identifiers,
            except for from, set, and target, which are safe to use and are already in common
            use.
            <code>
                as      const       export      get         null        target      void
                async       continue        extends         if      of      this        while
                await       debugger        false       import      return      throw       with
                break       default         finally         in      set         true        yield
                case        delete      for         instanceof      static      try
                catch       do      from        let         super       typeof
                class       else        function        new         switch      var
            </code>
            JavaScript also reserves or restricts the use of certain keywords that are not currently
            used by the language but that might be used in future versions:
            <code>
                enum        implements      interface       package         private         protected       public
            </code>
            For historical reasons, arguments and eval are not allowed as identifiers in certain
            circumstances and are best avoided entirely.
