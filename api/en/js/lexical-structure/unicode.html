		<h1>Unicode</h1>
        <br>
        <p>
            JavaScript programs are written using the Unicode character set, and you can use any
            Unicode characters in strings and comments. For portability and ease of editing, it is
            common to use only ASCII letters and digits in identifiers. But this is a programming
            convention only, and the language allows Unicode letters, digits, and ideographs (but 
            not emojis) in identifiers. This means that programmers can use mathematical symbols 
            and words from non-English languages as constants and variables:
            <code>
                const π = 3.14;
                const sí = true;
            </code>

        <h2>
                Unicode Escape Sequences
        </h2>
        <p>
            Some computer hardware and software cannot display, input, or correctly process the
            full set of Unicode characters. To support programmers and systems using older technology, 
            JavaScript defines escape sequences that allow us to write Unicode characters
            using only ASCII characters. These Unicode escapes begin with the characters \u and
            are either followed by exactly four hexadecimal digits (using uppercase or lowercase
            letters A–F) or by one to six hexadecimal digits enclosed within curly braces. These
            Unicode escapes may appear in JavaScript string literals, regular expression literals,
            and identifiers (but not in language keywords). The Unicode escape for the character
            “é,” for example, is \u00E9; here are three different ways to write a variable name that
            includes this character:
            <code>
                let café = 1; // Define a variable using a Unicode character
                caf\u00e9 // => 1; access the variable using an escape sequence
                caf\u{E9} // => 1; another form of the same escape sequence
            </code>
            Early versions of JavaScript only supported the four-digit escape sequence. The version 
            with curly braces was introduced in ES6 to better support Unicode codepoints
            that require more than 16 bits, such as emoji:
            <code>
                console.log("\u{1F600}"); // Prints a smiley face emoji
            </code>
            Unicode escapes may also appear in comments, but since comments are ignored, they
            are simply treated as ASCII characters in that context and not interpreted as Unicode.
        </p>
        <h2>
            Unicode Normalization
        </h2>
        <p>
            If you use non-ASCII characters in your JavaScript programs, you must be aware that
            Unicode allows more than one way of encoding the same character. The string “é,” for
            example, can be encoded as the single Unicode character \u00E9 or as a regular
            ASCII “e” followed by the acute accent combining mark \u0301. These two encodings
            typically look exactly the same when displayed by a text editor, but they have different
            binary encodings, meaning that they are considered different by JavaScript, which
            can lead to very confusing programs:
            <code>
                const café = 1; // This constant is named "caf\u{e9}"
                const café = 2; // This constant is different: "cafe\u{301}"
                café // => 1: this constant has one value
                café // => 2: this indistinguishable constant has a different value
            </code>
        </p>
        <p>
            The Unicode standard defines the preferred encoding for all characters and specifies
            a normalization procedure to convert text to a canonical form suitable for comparisons. 
            JavaScript assumes that the source code it is interpreting has already been 
            normalized and does not do any normalization on its own. If you plan to use Unicode
            characters in your JavaScript programs, you should ensure that your editor or some
            other tool performs Unicode normalization of your source code to prevent you from
            ending up with different but visually indistinguishable identifiers.
