        <br>
        <p>
            JavaScript supports two styles of comments. Any text between a // and the end of a
            line is treated as a comment and is ignored by JavaScript. Any text between the characters 
            /* and */ is also treated as a comment; these comments may span multiple
            lines but may not be nested. The following lines of code are all legal JavaScript
            comments:
		<p>
        <code>
            // This is a single-line comment.
            /* This is also a comment */ // and here is another comment.
            /*
            * This is a multi-line comment. The extra * characters at the start of
            * each line are not a required part of the syntax; they just look cool!
            */
        </code>
