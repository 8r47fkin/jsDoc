		<h1>Optional Semicolons</h1>
        <br>
        <p>
            Like many programming languages, JavaScript uses the semicolon (;) to separate
            statements (see Chapter 5) from one another. This is important for making the mean‐
            ing of your code clear: without a separator, the end of one statement might appear to
            be the beginning of the next, or vice versa. In JavaScript, you can usually omit the
            semicolon between two statements if those statements are written on separate lines.
            (You can also omit a semicolon at the end of a program or if the next token in the
            program is a closing curly brace: }.) Many JavaScript programmers (and the code in
            this book) use semicolons to explicitly mark the ends of statements, even where they
            are not required. Another style is to omit semicolons whenever possible, using them
            only in the few situations that require them. Whichever style you choose, there are a
            few details you should understand about optional semicolons in JavaScript.
		<p>
        <p>
            Consider the following code. Since the two statements appear on separate lines, the
            first semicolon could be omitted:
            <code>
                a = 3;
                b = 4;
            </code>
            Written as follows, however, the first semicolon is required:
            <code>
                a = 3; b = 4;
            </code>
            Note that JavaScript does not treat every line break as a semicolon: it usually treats
            line breaks as semicolons only if it can’t parse the code without adding an implicit
            semicolon. More formally (and with three exceptions described a bit later), JavaScript
            treats a line break as a semicolon if the next nonspace character cannot be interpreted
            as a continuation of the current statement. Consider the following code:
            <code>
                let a
                a
                =
                3
                console.log(a)
            </code>
            JavaScript interprets this code like this:
            <code>
                let a; a = 3; console.log(a);
            </code>
            JavaScript does treat the first line break as a semicolon because it cannot parse the
            code let a a without a semicolon. The second a could stand alone as the statement
            a;, but JavaScript does not treat the second line break as a semicolon because it can
            continue parsing the longer statement a = 3;.
        </p>
        <p>
            These statement termination rules lead to some surprising cases. This code looks like
two separate statements separated with a newline:
            <code>
                let y = x + f
                (a+b).toString()
            </code>
            But the parentheses on the second line of code can be interpreted as a function invocation 
            of f from the first line, and JavaScript interprets the code like this:
            <code>
                let y = x + f(a+b).toString();
            </code>
            More likely than not, this is not the interpretation intended by the author of the code.
            In order to work as two separate statements, an explicit semicolon is required in this
            case.
        </p>
        <p>
            In general, if a statement begins with (, [, /, +, or -, there is a chance that it could be
            interpreted as a continuation of the statement before. Statements beginning with /, +,
            and - are quite rare in practice, but statements beginning with ( and [ are not
            uncommon at all, at least in some styles of JavaScript programming. Some programmers like 
            to put a defensive semicolon at the beginning of any such statement so that
            it will continue to work correctly even if the statement before it is modified and a previously 
            terminating semicolon removed:
            <code>
                let x = 0 // Semicolon omitted here
                ;[x,x+1,x+2].forEach(console.log) // Defensive ; keeps this statement separate
            </code>
            There are three exceptions to the general rule that JavaScript interprets line breaks as
            semicolons when it cannot parse the second line as a continuation of the statement
            on the first line. The first exception involves the return, throw, yield, break, and
            continue statements (see Chapter 5). These statements often stand alone, but they are
            sometimes followed by an identifier or expression. If a line break appears after any of
            these words (before any other tokens), JavaScript will always interpret that line break
            as a semicolon. For example, if you write:
            <code>
                return
                true;
            </code>
            JavaScript assumes you meant:
            <code>
                return; true;
            </code>
            However, you probably meant:
            <code>
                return true;
            </code>
            This means that you must not insert a line break between return, break, or continue
            and the expression that follows the keyword. If you do insert a line break, your code
            is likely to fail in a nonobvious way that is difficult to debug.
        </p>
        <p>
            The second exception involves the ++ and −− operators (§4.8). These operators can be
            prefix operators that appear before an expression or postfix operators that appear
            after an expression. If you want to use either of these operators as postfix operators,
            they must appear on the same line as the expression they apply to. The third exception 
            involves functions defined using concise “arrow” syntax: the => arrow itself must
            appear on the same line as the parameter list.
